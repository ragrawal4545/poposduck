# FAQ

## I read the description, but what exactly is Student Council?

Members make motions to discuss specific topics. After the discussion, members can make motions to add the discussed item to the meeting resolution, which is to be shared with relevant members of the CoC administration. Student Council allows students to discuss CoC related issues with their peers, and express the results collectively to the administration.

## What are some examples of the topics we can discuss in Student Council?

You can discuss anything as long as it is in line with the institute policies. Perhaps you find the CoC commons a little boring, and would like the CoC to make some changes to it. Maybe you have a course suggestion. Maybe you really want the CoC to consider hiring this specific professor for a vacant role. Perhaps you have a suggestion to the Devices thread curriculum. The List goes on! Student Council will make sure that the correct people hear your suggestions and concerns, and if possible, take the steps to address them.

## I am a 1st year, can I participate?

Yes, Please do! We are very old people and we need some young blood. Actually though, we need some people to make sure the organization continues, as most of the current organizing team is graduating soon. Even moreso, underclassmen make up a large part of the student population, so we very much want to make your voices heard!

## Was there a similar organizations in the CoC before?

Student Council is the result of the ongoing restructuring efforts of the student leadership in the College of Computing and a more inclusive continuation of the <a href="https://ucouncil.github.io/">Undergraduate Council</a>.
